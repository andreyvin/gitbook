# Signing up for Amazon S3

In this tutorial we will explain how to sign up for Amazon S3 in just a few steps.

## How to Find Out AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

You cannot use your AWS account to access Amazon S3. For that you need to generate AWS credentials that you'll later use authenticate in CloudBerry Backup.

To generate security credentials, take the following steps:

1. Go to [Amazon Web Services console](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click on the name of your account \(it is located in the top right-hand corner of the console\). Then, in the expanded drop-down list, click **Security Credentials**.

3. Expand the **Access Keys \(Access Key ID and Secret Access Key\) **option. You will see the list of your active and deleted access keys:

{% hint style="info" %}
You cannot retrieve the existing secret key. You can see the secret key only once immediately after creating. So, in order to get a secret key, you will need to create a new one.
{% endhint %}

4. To generate new access keys, click **Create New Access Key**.

5. Click **Show Access Key **to have it displayed on the screen. Note, that you can download it to your machine as a file and open it whenever needed. To download it, just click **Download Key File**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not write down the key or download the key file to your computer before you click **Close **or **Cancel **you will not be able to retrieve the secret key in future. Then you'll have to delete the keys that you created and create new ones.
{% endhint %}

Now that you've signed up for Amazon S3, it's time to use use the newly created credentials when [adding a backup destination](../../getting-started-1/installation-and-configuration/adding-a-backup-destination.md) in CloudBerry Backup.
