> See the following article to learn about managing Azure Active Directory accounts when using CloudBerry products: [Managing Azure Active Directory Accounts](/concepts/managing-azure-active-directory-accounts.md).

> Before restoring your backups to Microsoft Azure, please take time to learn about [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits). Among these limitations, please pay special attention to the quotas imposed on the maximum number of CPU cores allowed per subscription, because you will only be able to find out whether you are about to exceed these quotas via the Azure portal.
