## **Understanding Versions**

Different file versions are attributed to the same file only if their names are identical to that of the original file. This is why a file that has been renamed in a local storage will not be considered to be a new version of the previously named file.

CloudBerry Backup maintains the file version control by providing a synchronization layer between your cloud and local storages. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you never make any changes directly to your cloud backup storage without using the CloudBerry Backup application layer. Such interventions may cause your backups to go out of sync and ultimately, may lead to the lost of your data.
