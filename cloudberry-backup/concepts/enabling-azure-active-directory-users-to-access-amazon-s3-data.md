# Enabling Azure Active Directory Users to Access Amazon S3 Data

AWS uses [_IAM identities_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) to provide authentication for people and processes in your AWS account.

With CloudBerry Lab, you can enable your users to access your Amazon S3 data using their Azure Active Directory accounts. See the following articles to learn more about this feature:
