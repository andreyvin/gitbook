# Signing up for Microsoft Azure

To start using CloudBerry Backup with Microsoft Azure, you need an Azure account. Below is the manual describing how to sign up to Microsoft Azure services and to create a storage account.

## Signing up for Microsoft Azure

Go to the [Microsoft Azure website](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/).

Click **START FREE**.

Specify all of the required options and click **Create**.

### Retrieving Access Keys

To start working with Managed Backup Service, you first need to generate **Azure access keys**.

In the _Azure Management Portal_, under your storage account, click **Access Keys**. Here you can generate keys or use the default ones.

Write down the keys somewhere; you're gonna need them when adding a backup destination in CloudBerry Backup.
