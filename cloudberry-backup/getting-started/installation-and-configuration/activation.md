# Activation

CloudBerry Backup is distributed by a licensing model, on a per-user basis. Each edition of CloudBerry Backup \(five in total\)  offers a free 14-day trial version with complete functionality and a freeware version with the most basic functionality for personal use.

When you launch CloudBerry Backup for the first time, you will be prompted to select one of the following modes:

* **Home Edition**. This is a free version that supports only file-level backup. It can be run on a desktop \(non-server\) OS and on a computer that is not part of any domain.
* **Trial Version**. You can try any edition of CloudBerry Backup and all of its features for 15 days free of charge.
* **Commercial version**. If you've already purchased a license, you may enter the license key and start using the product right away. 
* **Restore-only mode**. This mode allows you to restore backups that you have performed earlier. No backup functionality is available in this mode.

In this example we will demonstrate how to activate the commercial version. Select **Activate commercial version** and click **Next**.
