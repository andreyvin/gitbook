On this wizard page, you can select whether you need to restore specific file versions, or restore to a specific point in time.

The following options are available in the wizard:

* **Latest version    
  **Enables you to restore the latest versions of your images available in a backup.

  > CloudBerry backups include only images that was modified since the previous backup date. As a result, selecting this option will restore only those image versions that were modified before the most recent backup.

* **Point in time    
  **Enables you to restore image versions available in your backup storage at the specified date and time.

  > CloudBerry backups include only images that were modified since the previous backup date. As a result, selecting this option will restore only those image versions that were modified before the most recent backup and are not yet available in the destination folder.
  >
  > If earlier versions of the corresponding images already exist in the destination folder, they will not be restored unless you explicitly enable their overwriting further in this wizard.

* **Manually   **Enables you to select which versions of each image to restore. You can specify which versions to restore on the [next wizard page](3.5.2-specify-the-restore-source.md).
