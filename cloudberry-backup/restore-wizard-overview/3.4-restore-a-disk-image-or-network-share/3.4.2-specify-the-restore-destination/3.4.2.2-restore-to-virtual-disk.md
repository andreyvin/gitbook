# 3.4.2.2 - Restore to Virtual Disk

Select this option to restore your backup to a virtual disk.

You can mount this disk as a virtual drive or use it in your Virtual Machine environment later on.

The following virtual file formats are supported:

* Hyper-V Virtual Disk \(VHD-format\), dynamic;
* Hyper-V Virtual Disk \(VHD-format\), fixed;
* Hyper-V Virtual Disk \(VHDX-format\), dynamic;
* RAW disk image, raw;
* RAW disk image, rawsparse;
* RAW disk image, tar;
* RAW disk image, tgz;
* VirtualBox Virtual Disk, dynamic;
* VirtualBox Virtual Disk, fixed;
* VMWare Virtual Disk, vmfsdynamic;
* VMWare Virtual Disk, vmfsfixed.

On the next wizard page, you need to select which partitions to restore.

> When restoring an NTFS partition, you can customize additional options. See [Restoring NTFS Partitions](../../../concepts/resizing-ntfs-partitions.md) for more information.

You can also reorganize the restored partitions by selecting the corresponding option. This invokes the **Resize Partitions** dialog window where you can create new virtual disks and map the restored partitions to them using the drag-and-drop operation.

After switching to the next wizard page, you can specify the destination folder for your virtual machine file.
