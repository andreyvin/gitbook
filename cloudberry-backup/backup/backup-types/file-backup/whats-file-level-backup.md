# What's File-Level Backup?

The most commonly used type of backup in CloudBerry Backup is file-level backup. It essentially allows you to back up individual files from your computer to the backup destination \(local or cloud storage\). This is great for backing up important project files, source code, personal documents, photos, presentations, Microsoft Office documents, and so forth. This type of backup is mainly designed to ensure that your most sensitive and important information is regularly backed up and therefore not vulnerable in the event of hardware malfunction or ransomware strike.

We do not recommend using file-level backup to back up your entire storage device. For this purpose, [image-based](../image-based-backup.md) backup is a better choice, and we suggest you take a look at it down in the section.

File-level backup can be configured in the so-called _Backup Wizard_ by clicking on the _Files_ button on the main toolbar or by using the _Ctrl+B_ shortcut.
