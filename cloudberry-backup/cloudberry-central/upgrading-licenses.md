# Upgrading Licenses

The latest version of CloudBerry Central enables you to update your product licenses conveniently and swiftly right within the website.

Under **Licenses**, click **Licenses**. Now you see the list of all licenses you have purchased. Those licenses that are eligible for upgrade feature a little yellow arrow icon that indicates upgradability.

Select the preferable product version. Note that once you've received the upgrade coupon, the inferior license will be permanently disabled. **If you click Update and fail to purchase the requested license, your old license will be disabled and you will be left without either license until you purchase the one you received the coupon for. **Click **Update**.
